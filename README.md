## Lets Learn a VS Code Setting

`"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true`
So the VS code setting that I chose to research was ""editorbracketPairColorization.enabled": true" due to the fact that I find this setting can be helpful. This setting matches the colors of a pair of brackets so that it is easier to find which bracket goes with which. This is helpful in cases
where one may have even forgotten to put a closing bracket at the end, or may need to rid something inside a pair of brackets etc.

## Lets Learn an ESLint Rule

This rule is important because it limits/disallows the amount of whitespace, which means that there are no spaces on a line etc. Although whitespaces do not cause any errors within the code, it still may be flagged. There are different options that come with this rule such as skipBlankLines: false which disallows trailing whitespaces on empty lines, skipBlankLines: true which allows trailing whitespaces on empty lines and more.
